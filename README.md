# Digital music box
## Overview
This repository hosts the Arduino code and circuit diagram for a sophisticated digital music box. The project ingeniously utilizes an SD card reader to play designated audio files continuously. It incorporates an intelligent pause-resume mechanism 
that halts playback when the box is closed and seamlessly resumes when reopened.

## Project Evolution
### Initial Setup
The project's inception involved repurposing a traditional wind-up music box by removing its winding mechanism, laying the groundwork for its digital transformation.

### Circuit Details
Powered by a single 12V battery with a meticulously crafted switch, the circuit boasts an array of components including a TISEKER Mini Nano V3.0 ATmega328P Microcontroller Board, a Micro SD TF Card Reader, a compact laptop speaker, and a Plastic Reed Switch, 
meticulously integrated for optimal performance.

### Testing
Rigorous testing of both the circuit and code ensued on a breadboard, where a magnet was employed to simulate the operation of the magnetic reed switch, validating the pause mechanism's functionality.

Later a 12 to 5v regulator had to be made for the project this was also made and tested on a breadboard.

## Completion and Deployment
### Project Assembly
Upon successful testing and refinement, the components were soldered together and housed within the box. A precision cutout was crafted at the bottom to accommodate the battery and power switch. Additionally, a magnet was securely affixed to the 
lid, ensuring seamless contact with the reed switch upon closure.
